My research interests are in the broad areas of sanitation, waste management, the circular economy and integrated natural resource management. I have previously worked at Makerere University and at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) on research projects to investigate the feasibility of using faecal sludge as a solid fuel, develop a methodology for rapid quantification and characterization of faecal sludge and to assess the appropriateness of sanitation technologies and systems. I have also worked as a consultant; designing decentralized faecal sludge treatment plants, conducting environment impact assessments and developing strategies for improving industrial wastewater management for clients such as the Water for People (Rwanda) and the National Water & Sewerage Corporation of Uganda.

My educational background is in infrastructure planning, civil and environmental engineering. I have a licentiate of engineering in planning and decision analysis and a master’s degree in environmental engineering and sustainable infrastructure, both from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Makerere University. I have also trained in the Global Village for Future Leaders of Business and Industry programme at Lehigh University.

Since 2018, I’m enrolled as a PhD student in the Division for Sustainability Assessment and Management at KTH SEED. My research aims at contributing towards accelerating the transition to a circular and bio-based economy by identifying the factors that hinder or facilitate the implementation of resource recovery from urban organic waste streams and how city-level estimates, and sustainability assessment of resource recovery potential can contribute to urban waste and resource planning processes. The research is embedded within the UrbanCircle project in a collaboration between KTH and the Stockholm Environment Institute, where I work as research associate.
