Hi! Welcome to my website.

I am an environmental engineer and researcher based at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), and also affiliated with KTH Royal Institute of Technology. On this website, I aim to collate my work from various locations on the internet into one portfolio. You can explore and access free copies of my [Publications](/publications), see the [Projects](/projects) I am currently working on, access videos and other media from my public [Talks](/talks), and also follow updates from my [Blog](/posts). My contact information, bio and [CV](/cv) are also available, and you can connect with me on social media via the channels listed in my profile.

The overarching goal of my work is to generate knowledge and insights that contribute towards strategies for sustainable development in urban contexts. I combine applied scientific research and capacity development activities to tackle contemporary challenges at the intersection of urban
infrastructure and natural resource management, with a focus on the social-technical aspects of urban water, sanitation, waste management and the circular economy. My most recent projects focus on understanding the conditions that can accelerate the transition to circular sanitation and waste management systems in urban areas, including developing tools for infrastructure planning in multi-stakeholder contexts as well as comprehensive sustainability and governance assessments. 

With training in engineering as well as planning and decision analysis, and significant international experience, I am able to bring interdisciplinary approaches to my work, weaving in both quantitative and qualitative methods. I am also able to utilise approaches that easily translate scientific output into policy and practice within multistakeholder settings. My work has been featured on *Gizmodo*, *Welt-sichten*, *Smart Cities Dive* and on the *Canadian Broadcasting Corporation*, and also been published in high-ranking scientific journals such as *Environmental Management*, *Earth System Governance* and *Sustainable Cities and Society*.

My professional experience includes projects in the East Africa region, South America, Europe and Asia, in research, consulting and practice and I co-lead the working group on productive sanitation and food security in the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance. My academic background includes degrees in planning and decision analysis (Licentiate) as well as civil and environmental engineering (MSc & BSc). 

When not thinking about things like pee & poo and their linkages with sustainable development, I enjoy reading a good book, walking in the woods, or visiting with friends. I am also an avid musician and play multiple instruments.
