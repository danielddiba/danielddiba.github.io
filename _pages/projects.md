Below is an overview of some projects that I currently work on or which I have contributed to in the past.

## International training programme on sustainable urban water and sanitation
#### 2017-2021: East Africa
The aim of this capacity development program is to contribute towards improved planning and implementation of sustainable urban water and sanitation services which take into consideration the needs of all people, including marginalized groups. Since 2017, the program has engaged twelve urban water and sanitation professionals each year from each of the following countries; Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Zambia - a total of 240 professionals to date. The program involves workshop-based training, benchmarking and study tours and year-long capstone projects by each participant, embedded within their home organization. I serve as mentor to the Kenyan participants in the program. The program is funded by Sida and led by Niras and Water Aid.

## WASH Thinking Connected to Hydrology (Bolivia WATCH)
#### 2018-2021: Bolivia
This Sida-funded program combines research with capacity development and policy engagement activities with the overarching aim of improving conditions in Bolivian watersheds by sustainably and resiliently managing water resources and sanitation systems to improve human health and wellbeing, agricultural productivity, energy production and ecosystem function to improve livelihoods for all watershed residents. 

## Urban waste into circular economy benefits (UrbanCircle)
#### 2018-2021: Kenya, Colombia, Sweden
Focusing on cities, this project which is funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas, is developing a way to integrate waste management and resource recovery into a circular economy. The project will visualise and highlight synergies between different waste and resource flows, particularly focusing on water, waste, food and energy so as to equip cities with tools to boost their resource efficiency, capitalise on waste and create novel governance structures, based on participatory planning and multi-stakeholder engagement.

## Resource-Oriented Sanitation in Emergencies (ROSE)
#### 2018-2019: Sweden
This project, funded by the Swedish Red Cross, aims to provide guidance for implementing a more systematic approach to ensure enhanced sustainability of sanitation provision in emergency camps, with emphasis on resource recovery and sustainable resource management.

## Phosphorus efficiency in Gallus gallus and Sus scrofa (PEGaSus)
#### 2017-2020: European Union
This project, funded within the European Research Area NETwork on Sustainable Animal Production (ERANet SusAn) aims at bridging the gaps in the phosphorus value chain within livestock production by identifying strategies for increasing the use efficiency of plant-derived phosphorus by monogastrics so as to reduce phosphorus supplements, reducing phosphorus losses and emissions from pig and chicken husbandry and increasing overall phosphorus recycling to contribute towards resource-efficient and economically competitive livestock production.

## The SEI Initiative on Sustainable Sanitation (SISS) 
#### 2015-2019: Sweden, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda
This Sida-funded project aims at injecting new momentum into sustainable sanitation provision across the world through a combination of research, knowledge management, capacity development, policy engagement and on-the-ground action. 

## Faecal Management Enterprises (FaME)
#### 2013-2014: Uganda, Ghana, Senegal
This ERA-NET SPLASH funded project focused on developing solutions for faecal sludge management that provide a financial driver to enhance service at every step in the value chain, by creating scalable reuseâ€‘oriented faecal sludge value chains that capture and create value from faecal sludge end-products.
