I recently wrote a blog post that has now been published on the website of the [Swedish International Agriculture Network Initiative](https://www.siani.se/blog/turning-wastewater-into-a-resource-a-key-to-food-security-and-climate-action/) (SIANI). In the article, I explore how regions like Murcia, Spain, are addressing water scarcity and bolstering food security by reusing treated wastewater for agriculture. This practice not only sustains agricultural production but also contributes to climate mitigation and adaptation by recycling valuable nutrients and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Emphasizing the need for innovative solutions in wastewater management, the article calls for greater engagement, efficient resource recovery, and strategic financing to overcome existing challenges to scaling up resource recovery from wastewater.

The article was inspired by work that I did together with many other colleagues from around the world throughout 2022 and 2023 to contribute to a UNEP report that was launched at World Water Week 2023 - ["Wastewater - Turning Problem to Solution"](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/wastewater-turning-problem-solution).
