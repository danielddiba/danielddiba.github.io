This week, I had the opportunity of attending the 9th Africa Water Week in Cairo, Egypt, a flagship event convened by the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW). This year’s event brought together experts, policymakers, and stakeholders from across Africa and beyond to address the pressing challenges in water management and WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) services provision on the continent. Under the theme of "Placing Water and Sanitation at the Heart of Achieving Agenda 2063: the Africa We Want", Africa Water Week fostered dialogue and showcased innovative solutions, bringing the vision of Agenda 2063 and the Africa Water Vision 2025 into sharper focus. Throughout the conference, I had the opportunity to participate in several sessions and engage in discussions on sanitation, climate resilience, resource recovery, and the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus, as described below.

## Highlighting sanitation in climate action
On Monday, 14th October, I presented at a session led by WaterAid, titled “WASH in climate action – a cornerstone for a climate-resilient Africa.” In this session, I emphasized the importance of integrating sanitation and climate policies to build resilient WASH systems that are vital for Africa’s adaptation strategies. Drawing from SEI’s recent research, I shared insights on how African countries are incorporating WASH considerations in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). The session provided a platform to exchange lessons from countries like Zambia, Mozambique, and Ethiopia, and highlighted gender-responsive approaches essential for inclusive WASH and climate resilience.

## Wastewater as a climate solution
On Tuesday morning, I joined a UNEP-led panel in a session on “Achieving sustainable wastewater management and sanitation provision in Africa.” Here, I discussed wastewater as an untapped resource for climate mitigation and energy generation, advocating for accelerated investment in climate-friendly wastewater management practices. My presentation highlighted sanitation’s substantial methane emissions, underscoring its potential in contributing to progress on the Global Methane Pledge. We discussed scalable, integrated approaches to wastewater management that contribute to climate resilience, mitigate environmental impact, and support the energy needs of African communities.

## Operationalizing the Water-Energy-Food nexus
Later that day, I presented in a session organized by my colleagues at SEI Africa, “Leveraging Hydrological Data for Integrated Water-Energy-Food Nexus Solutions.” My focus was on how resource recovery from sanitation and other organic waste streams can drive the WEF nexus forward. I introduced the [Resource Recovery Toolbox](https://www.sei.org/projects/resource-recovery-toolbox/), a digital platform that SEI is developing to collate tools and resources for stakeholders interested in planning and implementing resource recovery projects. With over 100 tools already gathered, the Toolbox is set to launch in early 2025 and will support more effective decision-making in resource recovery and more sustainable natural resource management.

## Strengthening partnerships and exploring collaborations
In addition to the sessions, Africa Water Week provided a valuable opportunity to connect with partners from across the water and environmental sectors. I met with colleagues from organizations such as UNEP's Global Wastewater Initiative, IUCN, the Water Sector Trust Fund in Kenya, UNICEF, the African Development Bank, the Green Climate Fund, WaterAid, and others. These meetings allowed us to explore ongoing initiatives, potential collaborations, and shared objectives in water, sanitation, and climate resilience.
