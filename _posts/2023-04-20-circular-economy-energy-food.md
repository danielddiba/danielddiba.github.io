On this page, I provide a list of relevant resources related to circular economy, energy and food. The resources are provided as a reference for interested participants in circular economy related events at the Gothenburg International Science Festival 2023. You can use the links/URLs to access each resource.

## General circular economy resources for reference, related to work at SEI
[**Accelerating the transition to a circular economy through impactful and actionable research**](https://www.sei.org/publications/transition-circular-economy-research/)
An overview of circular economy work at SEI, mainly addressing three key areas of expertise: circular bioeconomy, circular solid waste management, and circular water management. The overview highlights some of the research projects and publications that SEI has been involved in to support the transition to a circular economy in different sectors and regions. 

[**Implementing resource recovery from urban organic waste: Tools to support planners and policy makers**](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn%3Anbn%3Ase%3Akth%3Adiva-310924)
A collection of resources on tools for planners and policy makers for implementing circular initiatives related to energy, water and nutrient recovery from organic waste streams. The resources include the REVAMP decision support tool, a sustainability assessment framework, a governance assessment diagnostic tool and resources for developing resource recovery scenarios, as well as insights into cases where these tools have been applied and used.

[**Sustainability assessment of increased circularity of urban organic waste streams**](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.030)
A paper describing a framework for assessing the sustainability impacts of circular initiatives related to organic waste streams. The framework integrates some principles from life cycle assessment and social life cycle assessment methods to evaluate the environmental and social consequences of various resource recovery scenarios with circular solutions. The framework also provides guidance on how to communicate the results and recommendations to stakeholders. 

[**The Resource Value Mapping tool**](https://revamp.earth/)
This is a decision support tool for determining the resource recovery potential of a city’s organic waste streams. The tool, commonly called REVAMP, allows users to input data on their city’s waste generation and management, and then generates scenarios for different circular solutions, such as composting, anaerobic digestion, or fly larvae composting. The tool also estimates the environmental and economic implications of each scenario and provides a dashboard for comparing them, with regards to nutrient and energy recovery as well as revenues, respectively. 

[**The lack of social impact considerations in transitioning towards urban circular economies: a scoping review**](https://www.sei.org/publications/lack-social-impact-urban-circular/)
A recent paper on the social impacts of the circular economy, highlighting that the focus thus far is mostly on employment and governance while areas such as culture, health, people’s fears and aspirations etc which can also be impacted by the transition to circular economy are less explored. The paper also identifies some gaps and challenges for future research and practice on this topic.

## Specific resources about circular economy and energy
[**Energy from excreta: harnessing energy from one of the most abundant materials on the planet**](https://v-a.se/english-portal/projects/activity-projects/anthology-on-energy/)
A book chapter that discusses the opportunities and challenges for recovering energy from excreta, one of the most abundant materials on the planet. The chapter explains how excreta can be used as a source of biogas, heat, electricity, and biofuels, and what are the technical, social, and environmental barriers and benefits of doing so. The chapter also presents some examples of projects and initiatives that are harnessing energy from excreta in different countries and contexts. The chapters is included within the book [_Towards the energy of the future – the invisible revolution behind the electrical socket_](https://v-a.se/english-portal/projects/activity-projects/anthology-on-energy/) (pp. 67–75).

[**Faecal sludge as a solid industrial fuel: a pilot-scale study**](https://doi.org/10.2166/washdev.2017.089)
A paper that explores the feasibility of using dried faecal sludge as an industrial fuel in urban areas of emerging countries. The paper compares the characteristics of dried faecal sludge with other fuels such as coal, wood, and charcoal, and assesses the potential environmental impacts and benefits of using it, with insights from pilots run in Uganda and Senegal. The paper also discusses some key challenges and opportunities for scaling up the use of dried faecal sludge as a fuel, such as regulatory frameworks, social acceptance, and market development. 

## Specific resources about circular economy and food
The following resources offer some insights related to how circular economy can be applied to food in different contexts and scales:

[**Swedish sludge management at the crossroads**](https://www.sei.org/publications/swedish-sludge-crossroads/)
A brief by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) that argues for a system perspective on nutrient recycling in Swedish sanitation systems, and how this is affected by current policies. A related brief also examines the [implications of these policies for Swedish municipalities](https://www.sei.org/publications/implications-of-new-national-policies-on-sewage-sludge-management-for-a-swedish-municipality/) that are trying to implement circular solutions for sewage sludge management.

[**Identifying barriers and opportunities for a circular phosphorus economy in the Baltic Sea region**](https://www.sei.org/publications/barriers-opportunities-p-reuse-baltic/)

A paper by SEI that explores the opportunities and barriers for phosphorus and nutrient recycling in the Baltic Sea region, which faces challenges such as eutrophication, soil degradation, and food security. The paper identifies key actors and drivers for promoting circular nutrient solutions, and provides recommendations for policy and practice.

[**Circular nutrient solutions for agriculture and wastewater – a review of technologies and practices**](https://www.sei.org/publications/circular-nutrient-solutions-for-agriculture-and-wastewater/)

A paper providing an overview by SEI of relevant technologies and practices for circular nutrient solutions for agriculture and wastewater management, such as composting, anaerobic digestion, struvite precipitation, and biochar production. The overview also assesses the potential benefits and drawbacks of these solutions in terms of environmental, social, and economic aspects.
