On this page, I provide a list of relevant resources related to circular economy, energy and food. The resources are provided as a reference for interested participants in circular economy related events at the Gothenburg International Science Festival 2023.

## Specific resources about circular economy and food
Circular economy is a way of designing and managing systems that eliminates waste and pollution, keeps products and materials in use, and restores natural capital. This approach can help address global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity. In the food sector, circular economy means mimicking nature’s cycles of regeneration so that organic resources can be safely returned to the soil or used for other purposes.

The following resources offer some insights related to how circular economy can be applied to food in different contexts and scales:

[**Swedish sludge management at the crossroads**](https://www.sei.org/publications/swedish-sludge-crossroads/)
A brief by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) that argues for a system perspective on nutrient recycling in Swedish sanitation systems, and how this is affected by current policies. A related brief also examines the [implications of these policies for Swedish municipalities](https://www.sei.org/publications/implications-of-new-national-policies-on-sewage-sludge-management-for-a-swedish-municipality/) that are trying to implement circular solutions for sewage sludge management.

[Identifying barriers and opportunities for a circular phosphorus economy in the Baltic Sea region](https://www.sei.org/publications/barriers-opportunities-p-reuse-baltic/)
A paper by SEI that explores the opportunities and barriers for phosphorus and nutrient recycling in the Baltic Sea region, which faces challenges such as eutrophication, soil degradation, and food security. The paper identifies key actors and drivers for promoting circular nutrient solutions, and provides recommendations for policy and practice.

[Circular nutrient solutions for agriculture and wastewater – a review of technologies and practices](https://www.sei.org/publications/circular-nutrient-solutions-for-agriculture-and-wastewater/)
A paper providing an overview by SEI of relevant technologies and practices for circular nutrient solutions for agriculture and wastewater management, such as composting, anaerobic digestion, struvite precipitation, and biochar production. The overview also assesses the potential benefits and drawbacks of these solutions in terms of environmental, social, and economic aspects.
