Together with my colleagues at SEI - Nhilce Esquivel and Carla Liera and other colleagues from the [Climate Resilient Sanitation Coalition](https://www.susana.org/community/themes/climate-resilient-sanitation-coalition), we recently published an article on the SDG Knowledge Hub, introducing the newly developed Practical Guidelines for Designing Climate-resilient Sanitation Projects for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). These guidelines, a collaborative effort put together by members the Climate Resilient Sanitation Coalition, provide actionable recommendations for integrating climate adaptation and mitigation within sanitation projects, aiming to secure essential funding for vulnerable communities facing climate-related sanitation challenges. Set to launch at COP29, the guidelines offer practical tools for national governments and other stakeholders to align sanitation with climate strategies and access GCF funding.

The Guidelines will be launched at the 2024 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan in an event at the Climate Funds joint pavilion on Monday 11th November at 15:15-16:45 Baku time.
